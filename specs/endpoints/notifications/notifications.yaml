    You can always send an audio clip to the list of headsets. Essentially you have 3 options:

    - you can send mp3 audio as base64 (for one-time notification)

    - you can save audio first via our API and then use it as many times as you want with ID that references to it (preferable option, see also `/upload`)

    - you can provide a simple string and our service will pronounce it and make mp3 record for you (text to speech).
